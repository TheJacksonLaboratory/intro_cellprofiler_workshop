# Introduction to CellProfiler Workshop

This repository houses the materials for the Introduction to CellProfiler workshop, as run at JAX.

In addition to the [slides introducing CellProfiler](https://thejacksonlaboratory.github.io/intro_cellprofiler_workshop/), the following CellProfiler tutorials were used:

- [Beginner Segmentation](https://tutorials.cellprofiler.org/#beginner-segmentation)
- [Input Modules](https://tutorials.cellprofiler.org/#input-modules)

Note: the slides were prepared using [Quarto RevealJS](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/). To edit, edit the `.qmd` file and then re-render using quarto CLI (GitHub action to follow).
