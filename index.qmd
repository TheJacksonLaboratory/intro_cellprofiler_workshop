## Plan for Day 1

- Introduction to CellProfiler
- Overview of basic CellProfiler concepts
    - projects, pipelines, modules 
- User Interface (UI) Walk-through
- Hands-on tutorial

---

## A bit of background

- project started in 2003 by Anne Carpenter and Thouis Jones at MIT
- currently developed by [the Beth Cimini lab](https://cimini-lab.broadinstitute.org/) at the Broad Institute
- \>15000 publications citing CellProfiler

### What is CellProfiler

CellProfiler is an open-source image analysis program


It has a graphical interface for assembling image processing and analysis workflows (called `pipelines`) using a sequence of modular analysis `modules` 

---

### What is CellProfiler

In contrast to ImageJ, which is ideal for single-image viewing and processing, CellProfiler was designed for batch image analysis using reproducible workflows

---

### The concept

- Create a `project` that has and image file list and an associated `pipeline` 
- Use the GUI to develop the `pipeline`
    - Start with images and end with measurements in a spreadsheet (`.csv`) or a MySQL database
- run in batches over large number of images
- analyze measurement data in the downstream tool of your choice (Python, R, Excel, CellProfiler Analyst, etc.)
