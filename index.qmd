## Plan for Day 1

- Introduction to CellProfiler
- Overview of basic CellProfiler concepts
    - projects, pipelines, modules 
- User Interface (UI) Walk-through
- Hands-on tutorial

---

## A bit of background

- project started in 2003 by Anne Carpenter and Thouis Jones at MIT
- currently developed by [the Beth Cimini lab](https://cimini-lab.broadinstitute.org/) at the Broad Institute
- \>15000 publications citing CellProfiler

## What is CellProfiler?

CellProfiler is an open-source image analysis program

<br/>

**Key feature**:  
CellProfiler has a graphical user interface (`GUI`) for assembling image processing and analysis workflows (called `pipelines`) using a sequence of modular analysis `modules` 

---

## Strengths of CellProfiler

- It was designed for batch image analysis using reproducible workflowsâ€”*without scripting*

- It *includes* advanced algorithms for image (pre)processing, segmentation, etc. as modular `modules`

- Includes in-app documentation for `module` parameters

- End-to-end: images go in, data tables go out

---

## Limitations

- Limited *viewing* capabilities:
    - single planes, single channels only
- No annotation tools
- Limited out-of-memory performance
    - no support for multiscale ("pyramidal")
    - no built-in tiling/chunking

---

### The concept

- Create a `project` that has and image file list and an associated `pipeline` 
- Use the GUI to develop the `pipeline`
    - Start with images and end with measurements in a spreadsheet (`.csv`) or a MySQL database
- run in batches over large number of images
- analyze measurement data in the downstream tool of your choice (Python, R, Excel, CellProfiler Analyst, etc.)
