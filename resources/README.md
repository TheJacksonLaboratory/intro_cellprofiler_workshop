Example 1, 2 and 3 - the images were taken as is or modified from the Example Human cells .

The images of human cells were provided by Jason Moffat.

Cell, 124(6):1283-98 / doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2006.01.040. PMID 16564017. The images in this example are licensed as CC-0.

Example 4 - the image of blood cells infected by malaria and stained with Giemsa reagent were taken from set BBBC041v1, available from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection BBBC.

Matching images

Example 1 - the images used are from the Example Human C-N translocation.

The images were taken from image set BBBC014v1 provided by Ilya Ravkin, available from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection BBBC.

Example 2 - the images used are from the Example Yeast colony classification.
